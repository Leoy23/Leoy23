## About me

üëãüèæ Hi! I'm Lee, a Front End Software Developer and small business owner of Joven Designs LLC with a passion for creating functional and visually stunning websites and applications. I graduated from both [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) and [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/), where I gained a strong foundation in software development and human development and family studies. I'm committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and events to support others.

Aside from coding, I enjoy creating art and music, which often influence my work. I believe that technology can bring people together and create positive change, and I actively seek out opportunities to support diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new places, trying new foods, and spending time with loved ones. I also enjoy reading books on personal growth and development, history, and culture.

Thanks for getting to know me! Let's connect soon.
