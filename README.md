## About me
<div>
👋🏾 Hi! My name is Lee and I'm a Front End Software Developer. I'm passionate about creating websites and applications that are both functional and visually stunning.

I'm a proud graduate of both [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) and [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/). These programs have given me a strong foundation in software development, and I'm constantly working to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.

In addition to coding, I'm also passionate about creating art 👩🏾‍🎨 and music 🎵. I find that these creative outlets help to keep me inspired and energized, and they often influence my work as a developer.

I'm committed to making the world a more inclusive place for all. I believe that technology has the power to bring people together and create positive change, and I'm always looking for ways to use my skills to make a difference.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me! I look forward to connecting with you soon.
